I recently asked folks at WeBuild what is the good resource on reading React source code. They give me some real good suggestions. I will leave them there:

- The dead simple re-implementation of React: https://github.com/MQuy/qreact
- Quick note on React internal: https://quannt.xyz/quick-note-on-react-internal
- react-fiber-implement: https://github.com/tranbathanhtung/react-fiber-implement
- Build your own React: https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/
- read-react-source-code: https://github.com/numbbbbb/read-react-source-code

Bonus:

- Rust architecture: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/architecture.md
- 10 Things I Learned from the jQuery Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_qE1iAmjFg
