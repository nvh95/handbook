Build your own DNS, Git, Redis, or programming language from scratch with Codecrafters.

<!-- truncate -->

[Codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) is a hands-on platform where you learn by building real-world technologies from scratch. You'll implement core systems like DNS servers, Git, Redis, HTTP servers, and even your own programming language. Each challenge guides you through the fundamentals while letting you write actual code that works.

It's free to try. If you like it (like I do), I partnered with Codecrafters to bring you **40% off for the 1-year plan**:

If you are living in some countries that support PPP (Purchasing Power Parity, e.g: Vietnam), you can get another 50% additional discount. That's a 200% discount for a family of 4. Just kidding. That's 70% discount in total.

## My Experience

Lately, I've been diving deep into DNS by building my own DNS server in TypeScript and I learned a lot. Reading through RFC 1035 and implementing every single response buffer has been an incredible learning experience.

Practicing with Codecrafters, my understanding of fundamental concepts has grown tremendously. It's worth trying if you want to challenge yourself to build well-known technologies from scratch.
